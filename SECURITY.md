# Security Policy

## Reporting security issues

The OddBird team and community take security seriously. We appreciate your
efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to
acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please open a private vulnerability report at
https://github.com/oddbird/popover-polyfill/security/advisories/new.

## Version support

While discovering new vulnerabilities is rare, we always recommend using the
latest version to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.

This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) principles.
Security updates will be released for the latest major version. Maintainers will
determine if security updates will be released for other versions, depending on
the severity of the vulnerability and the usage of other versions.
